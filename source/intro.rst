The case for Product Management
-------------------------------

Product Management is a discipline that arrived with the digital age. Products, of course, are older than that, however, products evolve more quickly while stying within the same scope. In the past century, e.g. a new car was released every few year, clearly indicating it'd be, e.g., the 1988 release.

With software, and particular cloud products, that may exist as a service and live in the cloud, concepts like "Continuous Delivery" evolved. These allow to release a new version of a product automatically, the moment it completes. It may include a minor facelift or a major new feature, independant of project plans.

This makes project management difficult, crying for a role of "Product Management". This document is trying to capture my experience in this area.
